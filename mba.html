<h1> What is an MBA? </h1>


<b>The Master of Business Administration (MBA)</b> is an internationally-recognized degree designed<br> to develop the skills required for careers in business and management. The value of the MBA,<br> however, is not limited strictly to the business world. An MBA can also be useful for those pursuing<br> a managerial career in the public sector, government, private industry, and other areas.
<br><br>
Most MBA programs include a "core" curriculum of subjects, such as accounting, economics,<br> marketing, and operations, as well as elective courses that allow participants to follow their own<br> personal or professional interests. Some schools require that MBA candidates complete an<br> internship at a company or organization, which can lead to concrete job opportunities after the program.
<br><br>
Quality business schools generally require that candidates have at least a few years of professional<br> work experience before starting an MBA program. Applicants are also asked to submit Graduate<br> Management Admission Test (GMAT) or Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores, academic<br> transcripts, letters of reference, and an essay or statement of purpose that reflects why they want<br> to pursue an MBA. Non-native English speakers usually have to prove adequate English skills with<br> TOEFL or IELTS scores, or through previous academic experience.
<br><br>
The MBA is currently the most popular professional degree program in the world. Today there are<br> over 2,500 MBA programs offered worldwide; most are offered in English. First introduced at<br> universities in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, MBA programs have evolved<br> to keep up with the demands of the times.
<br><br>
While traditional two-year MBA programs are still common, especially in the United States, one-year<br> programs have become increasingly popular. Part-time and online programs are also widely available<br> for professionals not willing or unable to take a year or two off to do a full-time program. Executive<br> MBA (EMBA) programs are part-time programs targeted at professionals with more years of managerial<br> experience than traditional MBA candidates.


<h1>When do I need to apply to an MBA?</h1>

Many business schools use the rounds system for application deadlines. That is, some schools have<br> four or five application deadlines. For business schools in the US, these rounds generally start in October<br> or November and continue through April or May (for fall intake). Students can apply for any of the four<br> or five deadlines, and the school will accept students during each application round.
<br><br>
But other schools don't use the rounds system, and instead require students to apply by one hard deadline.<br> Make sure to check the deadlines for the schools on your list.
<br><br>
If you're hoping to win a scholarship, keep in mind that some schools have special scholarship deadlines as well.

<h1>How do I choose which schools to apply to?</h1>

Choosing your schools is an integral part of the application process. Experts and officials often<br> remind prospective students to avoid applying only to top-ranked programs. Every student has<br> different needs, and it's important to consider a variety of factors when you're applying to schools,<br> including cost, specializations, contacts and geographical location.

<h1>What do I need to be a viable MBA candidate?</h1>

Business schools are looking for a certain set of baseline requirements from their MBA candidates.<br> First of all, it's essential that you have an undergraduate degree from an accredited university.
<br><br>
Second of all, you'll need standardized test scores, either the <b>GRE</b> (Graduate Record Examinations,<br> the standard test for a wide range of graduate school programs) or the <b>GMAT</b> (Graduate Management<br> Admission Test, the test specifically geared towards business school applicants).
<br><br>
Most schools accept either the GRE or GMAT, but most require that you took the test within the last five<br> years. Schools generally don't require that you achieve a minimum GMAT or GRE score, but many schools<br> publish the range of scores for their accepted classes.
<br><br>
Applicants who are not from an English-majority country usually must also complete a standardized test proving<br> English proficiency, such as the <b>TOEFL</b> (Test of English as Foreign Language) or the <b>IELTS</b> (International English<br> Language Testing System). Even schools outside of the English-speaking world, such as the University of<br> Mannheim's Mannheim Business School in Germany and China Europe International Business School in Shanghai,<br> require English proficiency.
<br><br>
Finally, you'll need work experience. Some MBA programs require two years of relevant work experience;<br> other MBA programs, such as Stanford’s, don't have any minimum work requirement, but even for these<br> programs most accepted applicants still have at least two years of work experience. For college seniors who<br> want to apply for an MBA, some schools will issue acceptances contingent on the applicant completing at<br> least two years of work experience before matriculating at the MBA program.



<h1> Where Should I do my MBA? </h1>
<b>"Where should I do my MBA?"</b> This is a question that many applicants ask themselves. For some, it makes<br> sense to stay locally, while others might find better opportunities (or just a great adventure) somewhere else.




<h2>You can do your MBA locally</h2>

Many people decide to do their MBA where they are already living. This option is good for those who are<br> generally happy where they are, and don’t need international experience. It can be also easier on the<br> budget, as tuition for residents can be less expensive than for non-residents; for some there may not be<br> the added expense of relocating.

People who are generally happy with their career or just want an edge<br> in their current job might consider doing a part-time MBA or an online MBA program, which can be adapted<br> to the needs to working professionals.



<h2>You can do your MBA to gain international experience</h2>

In an increasingly globalized world, many people find that having international experience gives them an edge<br> in business. Doing an MBA in another country can help with this, in that students are able to spend a year or<br> two abroad building their international business skills.

For example, non-native English speakers often decide<br> to do their MBA in the UK or the USA to help with their language skills. And MBA programs which offer internships<br> or consulting project components can allow students to experience the business world in another country first-hand.



<h2>You can do your MBA where you want to work</h2>

Some people use an MBA as leverage to move to a country where they want to live and work. For those who want<br> to move elsewhere, an MBA can provide some of the necessary ingredients, such as networking opportunities,<br> and connections to local businesses. However, people who want to move to another country need to be conscious<br> of issues like language, visa availability, and culture, all of which can complicate the transition.

Some MBA rankings<br> list schools in terms of “international mobility,” based on the percentage of graduates who end up in a different<br> country from where they are from.
